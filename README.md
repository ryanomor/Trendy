# Trendy App

Trendy is a web app built in a React frontend using Google's Material-UI library and a Java backend built in Spring Boot.  
  
Trendy is a social media app that allows users to discover new music and add them to their profile. The more new music users discover and add, the more likely they will get recommended to other users who share similar interests in music. And users will be recommended events based on the music in their favorites.  
  
Here are some examples of different user flows.

## Landing Page
The landing page gives an introduction of how the app works. Users can browse music, but can not access all of the features of the app until they sign up or login.

## Login
The user either signs up or logs in and is then redirected to their progile page.

## Sign out
If a user is no longer interested in a song they can remove it from their favorites. They can also do the same to a user in their friends list if they no longer feel friendly with the user.
